//teleporting side paths
//proper ghost realease
//bigger map <-- finished
//pacman and ghost dynamicaly change size with the gridSize <--- finished
//reset button
//stats area
//make a display screen like in the arcade where it introduces the ghost and pac man
//after bigger map make dynamic walls
//fix ghost movement bug    <--- finsihed
//make a way for ghost to know how to exit ghost house
